# Qualtrics Random Numbers

This project has two main functionalities.

1. Generate Random Numbers: This feature generates random numbers within Qualtrics, counts how many times a specific number occurs and displays it.
2. Button Click Counter: This functionality asks participants to press a button, counts how many times the button has been clicked and displays the count to the participant.

The repository contains two separate files, each for one of the above functionalities. It is important to read the comments inside the files as they specify where in Qualtrics you should place the code for it to work. The code is written in Java Script and uses some HTML as these are the technologies that Qualtrics uses.

Please note that this project has been created for academic purposes.
